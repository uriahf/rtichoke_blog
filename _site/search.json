For more conventional documentation of the package please visit rtichoke pkgdown website.\nSome of the posts will be replications of existing code that produces the same output as rtichoke by different packages.\nOther posts will be more focused on theoretical issues, but always with a reproducible code.\nI will also share some talks that might be about everything as long as there are some relevant outputs by rtichoke (Most of the talks will be in Hebrew but the slides will always be in English)."
