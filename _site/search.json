For more conventional documentation of the package please visit rtichoke pkgdown website.\nSome of the posts will be replications of existing code that produces the same output as rtichoke by different packages.\nOther posts will be more focused on theoretical issues, but always with a reproducible code.\nI will also share some talks that might be about everything as long as there are some relevant outputs by rtichoke (Most of the talks will be in Hebrew but the slides will always be in English)."

    "text": "Prediction Model might gain accuracy if you’ll add more relevant features to existing models, but many times it’s not obvious what is the additional value of additional feature and how to quantify it in terms of Decision Making. The post Decision curve analysis for quantifying the additional benefit of a new marker by Emily Vertosick and Andrew Vickers show a simple example (the code presented here is almost identical to the original code presented in the link)."
